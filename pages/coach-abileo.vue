This tool helps workers to be more autonomous and helps management in tracking workers progress and establishing a career plan. </div>

                <div class="section-title">Context</div>
                <div>The <a class="outlined" href="https://auticiel.com/coach-abileo/" target="_blank">Coach Abileo</a> was developped in partnership with an ESAT to address the specific needs of the disabled employment market. A beta version was released a few weeks before I joined the team. With more and more different clients we quickly realized that the specific tools developped for the management were slow to be adopted. After interviews and on site visits I draw the conclusion that the <a class="outlined" href="https://auticiel.com/coach-abileo/" target="_blank">Coach Abileo</a> failed to really address the needs of the managers. Therefore we worked on rethinking the product and the mid-term strategy to better fit the market expectations. As laws around the ESATS and specifically their use of digital tools are frequently being passed in France it was crucial to rapidly have a working product in order to be seen as a valid actor in this sector.</div>

                <div class="section-title">Problem</div>
                <div>Following the study conducted, the initial module fails to address certain crucial needs raised from the field:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability for a professional framework to contain a large number of competencies while remaining easily readable.</li>
                    <li>The need to evaluate a worker across all competencies within a framework quickly.</li>
                    <li>The desire to provide a well-informed evaluation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="section-title">Competences</div>
                <div>Regarding the consultation of competences, since the competences in a professional framework are grouped into three categories : hard—skills, soft skills, and knowledge, I opted for a tabbed display for these categories to avoid information overload.</div>
                <div>To facilitate a quick visualization of the worker's level relative to the professional framework, I also added an icon next to each competency name, indicating the status of the most recent validation. Additionally, the ability to group competences into collapsible folders allows for easier navigation in frameworks containing a large number of competences.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="full-background coach-abileo">
            <div class="text-block">
                <div class="section-title">Evaluation Interface</div>
                <div>To enable a well-informed evaluation of a worker, the competency evaluation interface has been significantly enhanced with:</div>
                <ul class="project-page-big-margin">
                    <li>Evaluation history: Previously, a new evaluation would overwrite the previous one; now, evaluations are saved in a historical record.</li>
                    <li>A graph representing the worker's progress in mastering the competency. This graph allows supervisors to easily identify any stagnation or even a decline in the worker's level and consider ways to address the issue.</li>
                    <li>The addition of a comment field for supervisors to elaborate on their evaluation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/coach-abileo/coach-abileo-comp-eval.png" class="coach-abileo" />
            <div class="text-block">
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability to mark a competency as "not currently evaluable," since all competencies in a framework must be assessed, but some may not yet have been utilized by the worker during their assignments.</li>
                    <li>
                        A statistics section displaying usage data collected from the worker's tablet, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of challenges completed.</li>
                            <li>The number of hours worked on tasks or positions requiring the competency.</li>
                            <li>The number of times the help content (sequences, tasks, quizzes) related to mastering tasks involving these competencies was accessed in the Coach Abileo application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>An "Evaluate and Next" button to move directly to the next competency evaluation without returning to the consultation interface for the professional framework, along with a progress indicator showing the current position within the framework.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
