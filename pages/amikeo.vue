                <div class="section-title">Context</div>
                <div>The position of Product Manager has been vacant for more than two years, and in the absence of a designer, all of <span class="outlined">Auticiel</span>'s products have been developed and maintained by two developers. This has resulted in a lack of coherence among the various implemented features, as well as limited visibility on specific actions required to evolve the product over the coming years.</div>
                <div>Given that <span class="outlined">Auticiel</span>'s product team is small (4 developers and one product owner/designer) compared to the number of products (12 applications and two cloud platforms), the teamâ€™s backlog is very heavy. Therefore, it was necessary for me to identify the most critical areas for improvement and propose simple designs that could be quickly integrated.</div>
