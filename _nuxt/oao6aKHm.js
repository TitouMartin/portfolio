A beta version was released a few weeks before I joined the team. With more and more different clients we quickly realized that the specific tools developped for the management were slow to be adopted. After interviews and on site visits I draw the conclusion that the <a class="outlined" href="https://auticiel.com/coach-abileo/" target="_blank">Coach Abileo</a> failed to really address the needs of the managers. Therefore we worked on rethinking the product and the mid-term strategy to better fit the market expectations. As laws around the ESATS and specifically their use of digital tools are frequently being passed in France it was crucial to rapidly have a working product in order to be seen as a valid actor in this sector.</div></div><div class="project-big-image-container coach-abileo-ipad order-img-1"><img src="'+d+'"></div><div class="project-image-double coach-abileo project-page-big-margin order-img-2"><div class="img-container img-1"><img src="'+v+'"></div><div class="img-container img-2"><img src="'+p+'"></div></div></div><div class="text-block project-page-big-margin"><div class="case-study-title-desktop project-page-big-margin"><div class="big-text">Designing with the</div><div class="second-line"><div class="big-text">users</div><div class="chips-container"><div class="chip blue">Onsite workshops</div><div class="chip blue">Reflexion groups</div><div class="chip blue">User interviews</div></div></div></div><div class="case-study-title-mobile project-page-small-margin"><div class="big-text">designing</div><div class="align-right big-text">with</div><div class="section-title">the users</div><div class="chips-container"><div class="chip blue">Onsite workshops</div><div class="chip blue">Reflexion groups</div><div class="chip blue">User interviews</div></div></div><div><div class="section-title">Problem</div><div>Following the study conducted, the initial module fails to address certain crucial needs raised from the field:</div><ul><li>The ability for a professional framework to contain a large number of competencies while remaining easily readable.</li><li>The need to evaluate a worker across all competencies within a framework quickly.</li><li>The desire to provide a well-informed evaluation.</li></ul></div><div><div class="section-title">Competences</div><div>Regarding the consultation of competences, since the competences in a professional framework are grouped into three categories : hardâ€”skills, soft skills, and knowledge, I opted for a tabbed display for these categories to avoid information overload.</div><div>To facilitate a quick visualization of the worker&#39;s level relative to the professional framework, I also added an icon next to each competency name, indicating the status of the most recent validation.
